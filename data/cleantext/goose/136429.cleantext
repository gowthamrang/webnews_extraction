{"Body": "The family of a Tallahassee teen shot and killed by police outside of a night club a year ago has filed a federal lawsuit claiming his civil right were violated.\n\nThe suit, filed Friday by attorneys Mutaqee Akbar and David Frank, claims Tallahassee Police Department officers Clayton Fallis and Derek Hawthorne used unreasonable force when they shot 18-year-old Duane Strong outside of Cheeks Sports Bar and Lounge last May.\n\nThe officers were cleared of wrongdoing by a Leon County grand jury in July.\n\nThe suit claims the two officers and the City of Tallahassee are culpable for the civil right violations and wrongful death of Strong.\n\nTallahassee police said Strong refused to get out of his parked Dodge Charger when officers responded to sounds of gunshots in the club's rear parking lot about 3 a.m. on May 29, 2014.\n\nStrong then sped away, collided with a car and nearly hit an officer.\n\nThe suit contends officers \"senselessly\" fired shots at the car before an officer on White Drive crashed his patrol car into Strong's in order to get him to stop. The car veered off the road, and Strong later died.\n\nThe officer who initially made contact with Strong while he was parked said he saw the teen put his hands in his lap when he noticed he was a police officer, rousing his suspicion.\n\nThe officer, who is not named in the suit, said he had reasonable suspicion Strong was either involved in the initial shooting or was armed inside of his car.\n\nWithin moments, Strong drove away and shots were being fired.\n\nPolice found two handguns on the driver's side floorboard of Strong's car and crack cocaine in the center console, according to the grand jury's findings.\n\nThe officers are being accused of civil rights violations for unnecessarily using deadly force when Strong did not pose a threat.\n\nThe suit also takes aim at the policies and procedures put in place by defendant City of Tallahassee that create \"an atmosphere of illegal and unconstitutional behavior\" related to use of force and that it failed to screen, discipline or terminate officers who use excessive force, profile and target establishments for harassment.\n\nThe city \"had a custom and practice of allowing officers to conduct illegal traffic stops, illegal searches and seizures, the targeting and profiling of local establishments for harassment and closure, the drawing weapons at non-violent persons, to use excessive, and unreasonable force without fear of discipline, thereby creating an atmosphere where such behavior is accepted,\" the suit states.", "Title": "Family of teen killed by police files federal suit"}
