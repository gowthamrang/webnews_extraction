{"Body": "After deputies arrived, one bar patron called for a \"revolution,\" a report says.\n\nAnother looked at an officer and declared, \"I'm going to shoot you,\" officials say.\n\nThose men were among the roughly 70 to 80 patrons who gathered at an unnamed bar on South Orange Blossom Trail early Sunday.\n\nThe party at the bar, located in a storefront near 45th Street in the Holden Heights neighborhood, ended with the arrests of two bar patrons: Douge Joseph, Jr. and Chrisnor Charlite.\n\nDeputies were called to the bar at 4:30 a.m. after getting a report about a fight, the Orange County Sheriff's Office said.\n\nThe crowd turned hostile after deputies ordered everyone to leave, saying they were breaking the law by serving alcohol past the 2 a.m. cutoff, according to arrest reports.\n\nCharlite, 42, shouted at the crowd, saying they should revolt and fight the deputies, according to his arrest report.\n\nHe was escorted outside, handcuffed and arrested.\n\nHe was charged with inciting a riot, threatening a public servant and resisting arrest.\n\nHis alleged call for violence inspired the other bar patron to defy a deputy, the report said.\n\nJoseph, 31, yelled at a deputy, saying he had no right to be there.\n\nAt one point, the deputy pushed Joseph back as he approached the officer.\n\n\"Joseph then yelled, 'That's okay.
