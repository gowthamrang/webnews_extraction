{"Body": "Three Rivers police shot and killed a man who they said wrestled a stun gun out of an officer's hands after leading them on a chase Wednesday night.\n\nIn a statement, police said Officer Monsies Robles stopped a green Ford Mustang for failure to use a turn signal at Oakville Road and Hackberry Street about 10:30 a.m.\n\nRobles then approached the driver and passenger, whom he believed to be in the country illegally, the statement says.\n\nOfficer Noah Leuschner joined Robles and asked the driver and passenger for identification, but they said they didn't have any, according to the statement.\n\nThe driver, later identified as Margarito Martinez Gallegos, then ran off, the statement says. Robles chased him while Leuschner detained the passenger.\n\nRobles called out to the suspect several times, identifying himself as an officer and ordering him to stop, but Gallegos kept running until he reached the front door of a home in the 1500 block of Hackberry Street, the statement says.\n\nRobles then used a stun gun on Gallegos because “I did not know what the subject's intentions were,” according to the statement.\n\nGallegos fell into the home and shut the door. Robles followed him inside and found him in the kitchen.\n\nLeuschner walked inside and requested backup from the Texas Department of Public Safety. Robles and Gallegos began scuffling, the statement says.\n\nAfter Gallegos grabbed Robles' stun gun and refused Robles' order to drop it, Leusch- ner fatally shot Gallegos in the abdomen with his service pistol, according to the statement.\n\nRobles was taken to an area hospital for treatment of leg injuries suffered during the scuffle.", "Title": "Three Rivers police kill man during scuffle"}
