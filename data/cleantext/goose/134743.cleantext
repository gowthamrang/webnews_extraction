{"Body": "As my grandmother lay dying in Moscow last month, her live-in caretaker, a former math instructor from Ukraine who had come to love my grandmother in the six years she had been with us, wrote in a Skype message to me: “The ambulance comes really fast now and doctors are under orders to pay special attention to veterans so they live to see Victory Day.” She seemed almost convinced that the Kremlin’s expressed will to keep veterans alive meant I didn’t have to schedule a flight from New York to Moscow quite yet. On some level of the caretaker’s imagination, deathless Putin himself would be keeping my grandmother alive.\n\nMy grandmother, who had never liked taking orders from the Kremlin, died one month before Moscow convened its celebration of the seventieth anniversary of victory in what Russia calls The Great Patriotic War, which in Russian historiography began in June 1941, when Germany broke its non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, which had been its ally for the first two years of World War II. This year, for the first time in my life, I had no phone calls to make on Victory Day.\n\nFor decades, I called or visited on May 9 and said, “Happy Victory Day,” and grandmother would have said, “This is the one holiday no one can doubt and everyone can agree on.” Coming from my grandparents, this meant that the victory over Nazi Germany was so huge and joyous an occasion that they had been willing to celebrate it with the Soviet regime, which they hated, and, now, with the Putin regime, which they despised.\n\nThis year, those words would have been difficult to say. The holiday, which has taken a variety of shapes and sizes in the last seventy years, has finally turned into a war-mongering orgy of such proportions that even the memory of triumphing over Hitler might pale in comparison.\n\nThe holiday has never, in fact, been rooted in living memory. For the first two decades after the war, the Soviet Union tried diligently to forget it. Casualty figures were kept secret. Discussion of Nazi crimes was strongly discouraged, and books about the Holocaust were censored. There were no parades or fireworks: May 9th was a workday like any other.\n\nIt was during Leonid Brezhnev’s nineteen-sixties that Victory Day became a celebration of Soviet valor. The tradition of military parades in Red Square was launched; Great Patriotic War veterans were paraded before school children; Soviet directors began making movie after movie about the war. It was a freshly written history with some notable omissions: the Holocaust was never mentioned, the official casualty estimate was fixed at the staggering–but still low–figure of twenty million, and the name of the Red Army’s commander-in-chief during the war went unuttered.\n\nEven twenty years after the end of the war, the number of veterans, many of whom had returned damaged physically or mentally, was starting to dwindle. To keep the pageantry going, the government kept expanding the ranks of people accorded the official status of Great Patriotic War veteran–first to include those who had never seen battle (because, in many cases, they had served in the secret police), then to include those who had worked in the rear for the benefit of the war effort, and later to include soldiers who had taken part in the Soviet Union’s later wars. My grandmother, in fact, received her veteran credentials as part of one of those expansions: her own plan to volunteer for the Army was foiled by pregnancy, so she stayed behind while her twenty-two year-old husband went off to the front and was killed.\n\nAfter the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia, which was uncertainly trying to find a post-imperial, post-militatristic identity, stopped the military parades. It also acknowledged that it had lost about twenty-seven million people in the war. In the nineteen-nineties, Victory Day briefly became a holiday my grandparents could fully enjoy. Moscow’s central avenue would be closed to traffic for the day, and my grandparents–three of them were alive at the time–would step out into a sea of people, most of whom would thank them and many of whom would give them flowers.\n\nThe first post-Soviet Victory Day military parade in Red Square took place in 1999. It was framed as a response to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, which had begun six weeks earlier, but the timing suggests this may have been a last-minute pretext. Russia was starting to reshape its politics, and this required tapping into what the country’s most perceptive sociologist, Yuri Levada, had long maintained lay at the heart of Soviet national identity: a sense of pride for the victory over the Nazis mixed with the pride of citizenship of a great and expanding power. Seven months later, Vladimir Putin came to power.\n\nOver the fifteen years that Putin has ruled Russia, the story of the Great Patriotic War has acquired new meanings and symbols. Stalin’s name and likeness have gradually been reintroduced into the story–and into the streets of Russian cities. A new visual symbol has been invented, the orange-and-black St. George’s ribbon. It once accompanied the country’s highest military medals, but now people tie a length of the striped ribbon to their cars’ antennae in advance of May 9th. The intelligentsia meekly protested the ribbon’s misappropriation and mass production, but it was too handy a symbol not to catch on.\n\nIn the last couple of years, St. George’s ribbon has turned into an all-purpose badge of patriotism, which can now be worn year-round. It was worn, for example, by thugs who attacked members of the protest group Pussy Riot last year. This year, Moscow schoolchildren were required to wear it to school on the Friday before Victory Day. It is now pinned to lapels, or enlarged to the size of a neck scarf, or worn elsewhere on the body–including as that part of a flip-flop that insures the toehold.\n\nThis Victory Day, Putin was snubbed by the Western powers, whose leaders declined his invitation to greet the biggest military parade yet in Red Square. He was surrounded instead by friends from North Korea, Venezuela, China, Zimbabwe, and a handful of other countries. They watched sixteen thousand troops march past, while others drove tanks or accompanied a giant nuclear submarine that looked like it had come up through the cobblestones in front of the Lenin Mausoleum. Putin gave a speech in which he underscored the relevance of the holiday for today’s Russia.\n\n“As we celebrate this sacred date today, we are once again made aware of the grandeur of the victory over Nazism. We are proud that it was our fathers and grandfathers who managed to overpower, destroy and annihilate that dark force. Hitler’s adventurism turned into a terrible lesson for the world community,” he said, using the very word–’adventurism’-that the U.S. State Department uses instead of the word ‘war’ when it talks about Putin’s own actions in Ukraine. “Back then, in the nineteen-thirties, enlightened Europe failed immediately to see the deathly threat of Nazi ideology. Seventy years later, history calls on us to be aware and alert once again. We have seen an effort of creating a unipolar world, and we are seeing force-oriented thinking gain traction.” Without naming the United States, Putin said that Russia needed to fight the enemy’s attempts to gain world domination.\n\nA car-window sticker that has become wildly popular in Russia in the last few weeks puts the same message in simpler language. It features two sets of schematic figures. On the left, a stickman with a Soviet flag in place of a head is anally penetrating a stickman with a Nazi flag for a head. On the right, the top’s head is a Russian flag and the bottom’s head is a U.S. one. The left pictogram is captioned, “1945.” The right says, “2015.”", "Title": "Putin’s Victory Day, Not My Grandmother’s"}
