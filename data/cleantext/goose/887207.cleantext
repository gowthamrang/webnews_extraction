The charge against Young was upgraded from felonious assault after the child's death.\n\nKinsley was rushed to a children's hospital on Dec. 2 after her mother called 911 to say she wasn't breathing.\n\nDoctors told investigators that Kinsley's injuries were consistent with child abuse. She was put on life support but died the next day.\n\nYoung and Kinner appeared in court Friday and are being held without bond.\n\nJudge Mark Wall addressed the packed cour room and warned against \"outbursts.\"\n\n\"This is a highly emotional case. I've been informed there have been threats made on Facebook and other things against the family members. I'll remind you those will be investigated and prosecuted. Intimidation of a witness, in any case, is a very serious offense,\" the judge admonished.", "Title": "Charges against Bradley Young upgraded to murder after 2-year-old Ohio girl, Kinsley Kinner, dies of injuries"}
