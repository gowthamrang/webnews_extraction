Two of the most-read cases in Limestone County involved a former Athens man accused in a double murder in Tennessee, a Limestone County couple charged in the bathtub scalding of two children, and a Madison police officer accused of injuring an Indian man in a takedown. Here are some of the major cases that occurred this past year:</p></span>\n                        \n                            </span>\n                            \n                        \n                    \n                        \n                \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        <span class=\"paragraph-1\"><p><strong>Double murder</strong></p></span>\n                        \n                        <p class=\"p402_hide no-images no-quotes yes-pagination\"/>\n                    \n                        \n                \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        <span class=\"paragraph-2\"><p>A Nashville police detective testified he noticed \"the smell of death in the breezeway\" as he approached an east Nashville apartment on Sept. 26.

The cousin had notified authorities after finding on her telephone a frantic message from Carroll seeking help. The recording of Carroll’s phone call captured Copeland in the background threatening to kill Carroll, Sheriff Mike Blakely said. Although Carroll left the message at 5:45 a.m., the cousin did not hear it until three hours later and then telephoned for help, the sheriff said.</p></span>\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        <span class=\"paragraph-25\"><p>Blakely said at the time of Copeland’s arrest Carroll might have been struck with a fire extinguisher found inside the house, though he said officials would have to determine how she was killed.</p></span>\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        <span class=\"paragraph-26\"><p>Copeland remains jailed in Limestone County.</p></span>\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        <span class=\"paragraph-27\"><p><strong>Friend stabbing</strong></p></span>\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        <span class=\"paragraph-28\"><p>A Madison man was charged with murder in August after he fatally stabbed his friend at a southern Limestone County home.</p></span>\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        <span class=\"paragraph-29\"><p>Benjamin Cordell Waddle, 26, of 102 Nolen Jones Drive, was later indicted for murder in the death of 35-year-old Michael Antonio Peoples, who had addresses in Decatur and Huntsville.

Shortly after 5 a.m., Limestone County deputies were called to Xtreme Performance at 15894 York Lane, where a group had gathered. Townsend had gotten into an argument with 24-year-old Zachori Keith Blackwell, and his wife, who lived on Blackburn Road. Blackwell had struck his wife and become aggressive toward her, authorities said. Others at the party then told Townsend to use his truck to block the gate to prevent Blackwell from leaving intoxicated. The release said Townsend did so, and Blackwell then shoved him down. After returning to his feet, Townsend pulled a gun from the front pocket of his hooded sweatshirt and shot seven rounds at Blackwell, striking him five times. The release said three of the shots were to Blackwell’s back.</p></span>\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                \n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                        <span class=\"paragraph-35\"><p>No trial date has been set.</p></span>\n                        \n                    \n                        \n                \n\n    </div> \n    </div></body></html>", "Title": "Couple bludgeoning, child scalding, grandfather takedown top list of 2015 crimes - Enewscourier.com: Local News"}
