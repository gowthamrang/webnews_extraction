The attacker struck as students -- bundled up against the bitter winter cold -- waited just before 7 a.m. for the academy to open. The powerful explosion blew out windows in shops and nearby homes, wrecking cars parked nearby.</p><p>Ambulances converged on the scene while authorities sealed off the area and blocked traffic. Some of those turned away from the scene were frantic relatives rushing toward the academy to look for missing sons.</p><p>The violence in impoverished but strategic Yemen has taken an increasingly sectarian tone, with many Houthis loyal to the region’s main Shiite Muslim power, Iran, although Tehran denies sponsoring the movement. Al Qaeda in turn has drawn a wave of fresh Sunni Muslim recruits in response to the Houthi offensive, said analyst Saeed Obaid al-Jamhi.</p><p>“I am afraid it will continue in the form of a Sunni-Shiite war,” al-Jamhi said.</p><p><em>Ali is a special correspondent.
