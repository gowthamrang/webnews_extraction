Fargo was a K-9 in Richland County. He was killed in December 2011 after chasing a robbery suspect.</p><p>“To me it’s a commonsense bill that strengthens something that needs to be strengthened,” said Collins, a first-term Republican. “I think the community is definitely in support of this.”</p><p>Four people were charged with two counts of attempted murder and one count of cruelty to a police dog or horse in the incident that led to Hyco’s death on Oct. 21.</p><p>Under current law, the offense is a misdemeanor with a penalty of 1-5 years in jail with possible suspended sentences, or a fine of $500 to $1,000. Offenders charged under the new law, if it passes, would face 2-10 years in jail with no possibility of suspension or parole and/or a fine of $2,000 to $20,000.</p><p>In addition, violators would be required to pay restitution covering the full cost of replacing the animal and could be required to serve one year of animal-related community service.</p><p>The same penalty would apply to anyone who would “willfully or maliciously torture, mutilate, injure, disable, poison,” a police animal whether it dies or not.</p><p>The penalty for abusing a police dog or horse would remain $2,000 to $5,000 and/or 30 days to five years in jail.</p><p>That applies to anyone who would “willfully and maliciously taunt, torment, tease, beat, strike, or administer or subject a desensitizing drug, chemical, or substance” to such an animal.</p><p>Not only are police dogs valuable to the law enforcement efforts of their handlers, but they are expensive.</p><p>Replacing highly trained dogs like Hyco costs about $8,000, Collins said.</p><p>“So we wanted to include in there some sort of restitution for the law enforcement agencies to be able to replace the animals,” he said.</p><p>Collins said he got the idea to upgrade the penalty for killing police animals after speaking to an animal rights group last spring. Fargo’s handler also was a speaker at the program.</p><p>Fargo, a five-year-old Belgian Malinois that worked for the Richland County Sheriff’s Office, was killed on Dec. 16, 2011 in circumstances similar to which Hyco died.</p><p>He had been released on an armed robbery suspect and had caught him when the suspect shot him three times with a handgun.</p><p>Collins was drafting a bill when Hyco was killed.</p><p>“At that point, the Anderson County delegation jumped on board,” Collins said.</p><p>Rep. Jonathan Hill of Townville had a separate bill in the works, and the two lawmakers merged their bills and drew language from a bill written but never introduced by Rep. Jenny Horne of Summerville.</p><p>The bill, H. 4448, has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Sen. Kevin Bryant, R-Anderson, has prefiled a companion bill in the Senate.</p><p class=\"article-print-url\">Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/1YNGzWN</p></div></div></body></html>", "Title": "Legislators prefile bill to stiffen penalties for killing police dogs"}
