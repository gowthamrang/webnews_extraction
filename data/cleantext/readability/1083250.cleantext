But it carries up to  96,000 gallons of diesel and oils, so they are monitoring it every day to prevent a spill, according to Lieutenant Brian Porter, public affairs officer for the U.S. Coast Guard's base in Memphis. </p>\n                  <p>The vessel is owned by Western Rivers Boat Management. Crews were able to get one of the boats out of the water, but the William Strait has been soaking for more than three weeks. </p>\n                  <p>The collision happened a few miles south of Memphis. </p>\n                  <p>“We’ll come out and look for any pollution just to make sure it’s not leaking,\" Chief Boatswain Mate Jon Tatroe told FOX13. \"If it is, we’ll have the company go down and fix that source of pollution.”</p>\n                  <p>Preventing pollution is the Coast Guard’s main concern. According to Lt. Porter, the 7,200 horse power tugboat is capable of carrying nearly 100,000 gallons of diesel fuels and oils.</p>\n                  <p>The Mississippi River crested at 40 feet Friday. According to the Coast Guard, it’s not feasible for divers to go to the boat when waters are higher than 34 feet.</p>\n                  <p>The boat will be removed from the river when the water levels reach 27 feet.</p>\n                  <p>Crews expect to begin the process of removing the vessel next week.</p>\n              \n  \n  \n  \n  \n </div>\n</div></body></html>", "Title": "Coast Guard monitoring potential pollution from sunken boat in Mississippi River"}
