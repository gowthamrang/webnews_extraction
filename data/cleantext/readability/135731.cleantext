The sheriff's office did not immediately return a call from The Associated Press to find out whether Carson had a lawyer who could comment on the case.</p><p>The incident occurred at the Full Throttle event in Huntsville, about 45 miles northwest of Knoxville. It was held at the Trails End Campground.</p><p>\"It's supposed to be a fun deal, and it is,\" Huntsville Mayor George Potter said. \"We had maybe 15,000 people here, and when you get that many people together, things can happen. But this is the first time anybody's been killed.\"</p><p>Potter said the event features the areas extensive trails for all-terrain vehicles.</p><p>\"They have singers in and they have trails that people ride their four-wheelers on,\" he said. \"People ride and have a good time and camp out.
