Anthony Bejaran said the deputy called for back-up after shooting the Taser. While additional deputies were en route the deputy reported shots had been fired.</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Jorge Ramirez said his son stood up after being hit with the stun gun and it was at that point that the deputy fired his gun.</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“He (the deputy) took two steps back and shot him,” Jorge Ramirez said. “We were yelling at him to leave our son alone. We thought he was going to turn the gun on us. When the other deputy arrived he had his gun pointed at us while my son was bleeding and dying on the floor.”</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Ramirez was taken by ambulance to a Modesto hospital, where he was pronounced dead.</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As of press time the sheriff’s department had not released an official account of the shooting.</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The deputy has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard, Bejaran said. The protocol is for the incident to be investigated by the Stanislaus County District Attorney’s Office.</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Jorge Ramirez said his son had been dealing with some depression issues as of late, mostly from his lack of employment.</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">“He had been doing good for a long time, but he had good and bad days,” the father recalled.</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Ramirez was a graduate of Turlock High School, Modesto Junior College and a tech school, where he studied architecture.</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">His family described him as a religious man who liked to draw and could play the guitar exceedingly well.</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Funeral arrangements are pending.</p>&#13;\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Anyone with information about this case can contact Detective Cory Brown at 567-4485.
