A resident of the neighborhood, Manyoun was stumbling in the street as if he were drunk. It's unclear whether Manyoun was stopped by Blanford because he was thought to be a suspect in the assault or because he appeared intoxicated. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/zo13B07nryg\" target=\"_blank\">Video</a> of the incident from a store surveillance camera shows the two men arguing, then Manyoun walking away. He returns into the frame wielding a flagpole (complete with red-and-blue striped \"Open\" sign) grabbed from the front of a nearby smoke shop. Manyoun can be seen running at the officer while swinging the pole. It breaks in half as the officer backs away and fires his gun twice at Manyoun, who later died in the hospital.</p>\n<p><span class=\"addcaption pic right\"><img alt=\"BustedMugshots.com\" src=\"http://cloudfront-media.reason.com/mc/_external/2015_06/deng-manyoun-bustedmugshotscom.jpg?h=200&amp;w=150\" title=\"Deng Manyoun\"/><span class=\"caption\">BustedMugshots.com</span></span></p>\n<p>At a meeting the next day, members of activist group Stand Up Sundays questioned why Blanford didn't try to stop Manyoun with a Taser, mace, or a baton first. \"De-escalation tactics are not used when it comes to people of color,\" <a href=\"http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2015/06/14/activists-meet-following-fatal-shooting/71210894/\" target=\"_blank\">said Tara Pruitt</a> at the meeting, covered by <em>The Post-Courier</em>. \"The officer went first to kill a man with his gun,\" said organizer Chanelle Helm. \"He did not subdue him.\"</p>\n<p>At a press conference, <a href=\"http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2015/06/14/man-killed-louisville-police-identified/71211006/\">Louisville Police Chief Steve Conrad defended</a> his officers' actions. \"Quite frankly, when you've got somebody coming at you with a dangerous instrument of that type… I don't know… that the officer had the opportunity to transition to a less lethal option,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Soon thereafter, a letter released by a local Fraternal Order of Police chapter called the activists \"sensationalists, liars and race-baiters\" and suggested that people might have to \"rise up\" against them. \"Your ridiculous demands and anti-law enforcement attitude has reached a level that is unacceptable,\" <a href=\"http://www.wlky.com/blob/view/-/33668404/data/1/-/128p37v/-/River-City-FOP-open-letter.pdf\">wrote David Mutchler</a>, a police sergeant and FOP chapter president. \"You want our attention?

But when activists arrived at police headquarters, <a href=\"http://weku.fm/post/louisville-protesters-call-union-chiefs-dismissal\">they found the doors locked</a>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"addcaption pic right\"><img alt=\"LMPD\" src=\"http://cloudfront-media.reason.com/mc/_external/2015_06/louisville-police-office-natha.jpg?h=179&amp;w=150\" title=\"Louisville Police Office Nathan Blanford\"/><span class=\"caption\">LMPD</span></span></p>\n<p>\"We had received information that the protesters planned to come into the headquarters building and occupy the building,\" <a href=\"http://www.wave3.com/story/29381521/no-discipline-for-union-president-lmpd-chief-says-after-protest-blocks-street\">Conrad told</a> local news station WAVE 3. \"We had additional intelligence that indicated that there was at least the potential for violence.\"</p>\n<p>\"It is unconscionable for the Metro Police Department to opt to close down operations at their headquarters, rather than engage with community members who have peacefully united to demonstrate their First Amendment rights,\" said former city councilwoman Attica Scott in a statement. \"This cowardice does not lead to positive change for the betterment of our entire community–it only hinders our capability to make progress on issues of policing and racial justice.\"</p>\n<p><span id=\"fold\"/></p>\n<p>Last December, <em>The New York Times</em> reported on the evolution of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/21/us/police-killed-desmond-rudolph-afterward-louisville-evolved.html?_r=0\">community-cop relations in Louisville</a>: \"Louisville, 270 miles east of Ferguson, had its fraught Michael Brown moment, or moments, when several young black men died in police shootings from 1999 to 2004.

After a U.S. <a href=\"http://www.cincinnati-oh.gov/police/department-references/department-of-justice-agreement/\">Justice Department investigation and consent decree</a> in the early 2000s, the city has embarked on a series of significant reforms that have transformed community-cop relations from totally poisoned to merely tense. A May 2015 profile in <em>The Atlantic</em> <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/05/cincinnati-police-reform/393797/\">explores this transformation</a>, noting that \"the city that once served as a prime example of broken policing now stands as a model of effective reform,\" but \"the lessons of Cincinnati are complicated. Success required not just the adoption of a new method of policing, but also sustained pressure from federal officials, active support by the mayor, and the participation of local communities. If Cincinnati is a model of reform, then it is equally a sobering reminder of how difficult it can be to change entrenched systems.\"</p>\n<p>I was in Cincinnati, my hometown, last week. When I arrived, the radio in my dad's truck was tuned to talk radio, where some conservative host was blasting the \"communists, anarchists,\" and other no-goodniks who were feared to be descending from nearby big cities to agitate. The (unfounded) fear turned out to be in response to the fatal <a href=\"http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/hamilton-county/cincinnati/quandavier-hicks-grandmother-questions-police-shooting-of-grandson\">June 10th shooting</a> of 22-year-old Quandavier Hicks by a Cincinnati cop, who had showed up at Hicks' Northside house after a woman accused him of harassment. Officers say Hicks reached for a rifle before they shot him.</p>\n<p>A few days before I left town, Cincinnati was once again in an uproar over a shootout that left one officer and one civilian dead in the inner-ring suburb of Madisonville. The civilian, 21-year-old Trepierre Hummons, called 911 to report a person with a gun acting erratically; he failed to mention that person was himself. When cops showed up, Hummons opened fire, hitting 48-year-old Officer Sonny Kim. Both Kim and Hummons died later at the hospital. Hummons had been texting friends about plans to commit suicide by cop but none of them notified police, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/20/us/ohio-suicide-by-cop-officer-killed/\">lamented Cincinnati Police Chief</a> Jeffrey Blackwell.</p>\n<p>Lexington, Kentucky—about 90 minutes from both Cincinnati and Louisville—has also <a href=\"http://www.whas11.com/story/news/2015/04/20/coroner-identifies-man-shot-by-officers-near-lexington/26069777/\">had several fatal shootings by city police</a> in the past year.
