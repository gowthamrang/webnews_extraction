Before the attack on Monday, 21 members of the coalition forces had been killed in Afghanistan this year, with 15 of them Americans, according to the website <a href=\"http://icasualties.org/oef/Fatalities.aspx\">iCasualties</a>. Most of the deaths were said to be caused by aircraft crashes or indirect fire.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"422\" data-total-count=\"1857\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">In recent months, however, American Special Operations forces have been drawn back onto the battlefield as Afghan forces have struggled against insurgent offensives that are threatening important population centers. United States military assistance from the air as well as on the ground was considered a crucial factor in the Afghan forces’ <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/world/asia/taliban-afghanistan-kunduz.html\">taking back Kunduz</a>, the first city to briefly fall to the Taliban in 14 years.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"283\" data-total-count=\"2140\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-3\">Now, as the Taliban make a major push in southern Helmand Province, overrunning districts and knocking at the gates of the provincial capital, Laskar Gah, American Special Forces <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/14/world/asia/afghan-province-teetering-to-the-taliban-draws-in-extra-us-forces.html\">have been reported</a> on the ground again to try to keep the province from fully falling to the insurgents.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"261\" data-total-count=\"2401\" itemprop=\"articleBody\" id=\"story-continues-4\">Local officials in Helmand on Monday pleaded with the national government for reinforcements, saying the district of Sangin remained largely under Taliban control after insurgents <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/21/world/asia/afghan-government-faces-new-set-of-rivals.html?ref=topics\">overran it on Sunday</a> after several days of intense fighting and heavy casualties.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"215\" data-total-count=\"2616\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">“Last night, NATO forces targeted two locations in Sangin, but it has not affected the Taliban momentum, and heavy fighting still continues,” said Mohammad Karim Attal, head of the provincial council in Helmand.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"175\" data-total-count=\"2791\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">Mr. Attal said the Taliban leadership, based across the border in Pakistan, had decided six months ago to seize Helmand and base more of the insurgent command in the province.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"278\" data-total-count=\"3069\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">In addition to Sangin, heavy fighting has continued in the districts of Khanashin, falling back and forth between government and Afghan forces in recent weeks, as well as Marja, Greshk and Washir. For weeks now, Taliban have also been holed up in Babaji, a suburb of Laskar Gah.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"143\" data-total-count=\"3212\" itemprop=\"articleBody\">“If the central government does not pay attention to the security situation in Helmand, the province will eventually fall,” Mr. Attal said.</p>\n        \n                                        <footer class=\"story-footer story-content\">\n    <div class=\"story-meta\">\n                <div class=\"story-notes\"><p>Mujib Mashal reported from Kabul, Afghanistan, and Matthew Rosenberg from Washington.
