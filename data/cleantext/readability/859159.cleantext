None of the protesters suffered life-threatening injuries.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Monday the felony charges he filed against the four men carry tougher potential sentences than any kind of hate crime-related charge he could bring.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Freeman noted it is possible that federal charges could be brought.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>&#13;\n                  </p><p>1 p.m.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Prosecutors have charged four men after shots were fired at demonstrators protesting the killing of a black man by Minneapolis police.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Twenty-three-year-old Allen Lawrence Scarsella, of Lakeville, is charged with one count of riot while armed with a dangerous weapon and five counts of assault with a dangerous weapon.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>A criminal complaint says Scarsella fired the shots that injured five protesters on Nov. 23.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Twenty-seven-year-old Joseph Martin Backman of Eagan; 21-year-old Nathan Wayne Gustavsson of Hermantown; and 26-year-old Daniel Thomas Macey of Pine City each face a riot charge.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>The shooting happened near a police precinct where dozens of protesters have been camped since the Nov. 15 fatal shooting of Jamar Clark.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Police say Clark struggled with officers.

Martin says the city can take back the street, but the protesters can have the sidewalk. He says he's staying.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>The encampment began soon after 24-year-old Jamar Clark, who was black, died in a confrontation with police officers. Some community members have alleged he was handcuffed when he was shot, which police dispute, and have called for video to be released.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Mayor Betsy Hodges said Monday the protest should end. She said campfire smoke is hurting air quality and the blocking of a street impedes emergency vehicles and snowplows.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Seven portable fire pits were burning Monday, and several tents and awnings were still up outside of the police station.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>&#13;\n                  </p><p>11:25 a.m.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Prosecutors in Minnesota say they'll announce charges against four men who were arrested after shots were fired at demonstrators protesting the killing of a black man by police.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Police say five people were shot in the attack on Nov. 23, which happened near a police precinct where dozens of protesters have been camped since the Nov. 15 fatal shooting of Jamar Clark.

But some people who said they saw the shooting allege the 24-year-old was handcuffed.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>&#13;\n                  </p><p>11:20 a.m.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges is asking for an end to a protest encampment that started two weeks ago outside a north side police precinct.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Protesters have maintained a presence outside the 4th Precinct since 24-year-old Jamar Clark died in a confrontation with police Nov. 15. Some community members have alleged that Clark, who was black, was handcuffed when he was shot. Police dispute that.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Hodges says protesters' campfires are hurting air quality in the neighborhood, harming children and elderly people who have respiratory problems. She also says barricades closing a portion of the street in front of the station are impeding access for emergency vehicles and snowplows.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Hodges was joined Monday at a news conference by U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison and Urban League head Steven Belton, who joined her in asking the protesters to end their demonstration.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>&#13;\n                  </p><p>6:35 a.m.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Prosecutors in Minnesota must soon decide whether to file charges against four men arrested last week after shots were fired at demonstrators protesting the killing of a black man by police.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Police say five people were shot in the attack, which unfolded Nov. 23 near a police precinct where dozens of protesters have been camped out since the Nov. 15 fatal shooting of Jamar Clark. No one suffered life-threatening wounds.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Prosecutors have until noon Monday to decide whether the men will be charged. They are all in their 20s. Three of them are white, and the fourth is Asian.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Police say Clark was fatally shot earlier this month after he struggled with officers. But some people who said they saw the shooting allege the 24-year-old man was handcuffed.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>&#13;\n                  </p><p>6:25 a.m.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>One of two Minneapolis police officers being investigated in the fatal shooting of a black man has been accused in a lawsuit of using excessive force during an arrest four years ago.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Court documents show the lawsuit against Dustin Schwarze was filed about 10 days before the Nov. 15 shooting death of 24-year-old Jamar Clark. The case was moved last Tuesday from Hennepin County District Court to U.S. District Court.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>The lawsuit alleges that Schwarze, who was working as a Richfield police officer, used a stun gun on a passenger in a vehicle that was pulled over by officers in Richfield in December 2011. It also accuses Schwarze of threatening to beat that passenger and another if they exited the vehicle.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>Two other officers and the city of Richfield are named in the lawsuit.</p>&#13;\n                  <p>The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is investigating whether Schwarze and Mark Ringgenberg violated state laws in Clark's death.</p>&#13;\n               <p>Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
