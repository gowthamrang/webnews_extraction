{"Body": "<html><body><div><div class=\"article-body\">\n                <p>A man stormed into a medical office building in downtown Fresno and fatally shot the mother of his five children before he killed himself, police in central California said Tuesday.<br/><br/>In a chaotic scene, people hid in bathrooms at the Eye Medical Clinic and were seen climbing from the building's ground-level windows as police arrived.<br/><br/>Arriving officers heard one gunshot, Fresno police Lt. Joe Gomez said. To help people inside the building get out, police smashed windows and helped people climb to safety, Gomez said.<br/><br/>Fresno Deputy Police Chief Pat Farmer said there are two businesses in the building - a pediatric clinic and an eye clinic. There were 16 employees and patients inside.<br/><br/>\"Several people were running out of the building frantically,\" Farmer said.<br/><br/>No other injuries were reported, Gomez said. Investigators found a shotgun inside the clinic, Gomez said.<br/><br/>Gomez identified the shooter as Neng Moua, 43, of Clovis. The victim is a 33-year-old woman, but her name was not released. Farmer said the woman was shot multiple times at close range.<br/><br/>The exact nature of their current relationship was not immediately clear.<br/><br/>Farmer said the couple did not live together but have five children together. The woman also had two other children.<br/><br/>The ages of the children were not released. They are all fine, authorities said.<br/><br/>Detectives searching Moua's home removed a couple of rifles, a backpack and two evidence bags.<br/><br/>Moua's neighbor, Russ Stidson, said he was a hardworking roofer who was friendly and outgoing and who would have parties his children attended.<br/><br/>\"To find out what he did, it just doesn't meet his character,\" Stidson said, adding that he never saw or heard any problems.<br/><br/>A motive for the murder-suicide was not immediately known but a custody dispute could have sparked the shooting, Farmer said. He said police had one prior domestic dispute contact with Neng 11 years ago.<br/><br/>On Tuesday, the call came in as a domestic disturbance shortly before 11 a.m., police said. Police said officers surrounded the building and ordered people to evacuate.<br/><br/>Believing they had an active shooter on the loose, police called in SWAT team members who entered the building.<br/><br/>Raquel Castillo, a 31-year-old caregiver, said she heard shots while inside with a patient visiting the clinic.<br/><br/>\"I heard him shoot three times and I heard people screaming,\" Castillo said.<br/><br/>A short search of the building led police to the bodies.<br/><br/>Several nearby businesses were evacuated and Fresno City Hall was locked down during the search.<br/><br/>\"This is a tragedy and we are grateful no one else was hurt during this incident\" Farmer said.<br/><br/>___<br/><br/><em>Associated Press writer Kristin J.
