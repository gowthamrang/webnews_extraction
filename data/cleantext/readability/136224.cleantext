The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that Jackson and Wilson filed to have the suit moved on grounds that it deals with constitutional issues.</p>\n<p>Brown, who was 18 and black, was shot by the white officer on Aug. 9, touching off months of unrest.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a lawsuit filed by Dorian Johnson, who was walking with Brown prior to the confrontation, has also been moved to federal court, also following a request from Jackson and Wilson. That suit claims that Wilson assaulted Johnson, violated his constitutional rights and inflicted emotional pain.</p>\n\t\t  \t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t  </div>\n\t\t\t  \n  \t</article>\n\t    \t  \t</div></body></html>", "Title": "Suit filed in Ferguson police killing moves to federal court"}
