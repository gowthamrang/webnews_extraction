To each their own.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_27145893/wisconsin-drunk-driving-suspect-b-c-d-im\">Pioneer Press</a>, 30-year-old Kong P. Vue crashed his car after 2 a.m. on Sunday. After police arrived, he explained that his axle broke, and added that he had a beer downtown. Intrigued, cops then had Vue recite the alphabet. He got to K before he blew it. <span id=\"default\"><span id=\"MNGiSection\">“A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-G-K — I’m gonna kill all y’all.” </span></span></p>\n<p>Obviously, he did not pass the test. Police arrested him, and he’s now facing a fourth-offense OWI, as well as for operating with a revoked license, and for a hit and run. Should’ve just finished the alphabet.</p>\n<p>[h/t <a href=\"http://www.twincities.com/localnews/ci_27145893/wisconsin-drunk-driving-suspect-b-c-d-im\">Pioneer Press</a> | Image: <a href=\"http://duinewsblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/shutterstock_13686838.jpg\">DUI News Blog</a>]</p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>", "Title": "Man fails drunk driving test after telling police he’s going to kill them all"}
