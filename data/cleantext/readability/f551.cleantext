High\nStreet shortly after 5 a.m. yesterday.\n<br/>\n<br/>Though Gatewood hadn’t been charged with killing Lance Glenn, 29, outside an after-hours bar,\nhe was considered a suspect, Custer said. He had a few outstanding warrants and didn’t have a\ndriver’s license, so patrol officers were told to pull him over if they spotted him or the tan SUV\nthat police pursued yesterday.\n<br/>\n<br/>Columbus police have identified the seven officers who fired their weapons during the\nshootout. All are in the patrol bureau.\n<br/>\n<br/>Their names and years of service are: Ty Stoneking, six years; Daniel Wolf, seven years;\nAndrew Ross, 15 years; Kyle Andrews, five years; David Salsgiver, five years; Patrick Daugherty,\neight years; and Craig Haller, six years.\n<br/>\n<br/>Stoneking and Wolf were treated at Riverside Methodist Hospital after being struck by glass\nshards during the chase.\n<br/>\n<br/> \n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/allymanning\" target=\"_blank\">@allymanning</a></p></article> &#13;\n</div></body></html>", "Title": "Officers involved in Clintonville shootout are identified by police"}
