She was a little scared by the Stormtroopers but hopefully now that she seen her uncle dancing as a Stormtrooper - I sent her a video, trying to humanise the trooper! - she might come around.\"</p> <p>Hall says he'll wait until he can take his 4-year-old nephew Isaac on Boxing Day. \"I think it's important to remember for us older fans that the new Star Wars films aren't really being made for us, they're being made primarily for the kids and younger fans of today and, just as <i>Return of the Jedi</i> blew me away when I first saw it in 1983 as a 4-year-old, <i>The Force Awakens</i> will have to have some new tricks up its sleeve to impress the likes of Isaac.\"</p> <p>So what does <i>The Force Awakens</i> have to do to impress the Star Wars hardcore?</p> <p>\"To create magic ... to remind us that there's more to our universe than the things we see in our daily lives on our small planet in our remote corner of the galaxy. I have no doubt it will do so,\" says David Rei Miller - one of the fanboy squad TimeOut has tapped on page 11 to name the 10 best <i>Star Wars</i> scenes.</p> <p>\"It needs to tell another great and grand adventure set a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away with heart and humour and not take itself too seriously,\" says his mate Anthony Naganathan. \"It needs to be fun. But it also needs good quotes.\"</p> <p>* Special thanks to Mat Bedogni for the use of his Stormtrooper armour and to Pony McTate for her cast of crochet creations on the cover.
