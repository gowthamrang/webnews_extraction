I can assure you that is not what happened last night,\" Berkeley Mayor Theodore Hoskins said this morning.\n</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nHoskins said that he has watched the video of the incident and, though they are going to complete two thorough investigations by both the local police and the county police, he differentiated Tuesday night's shooting from other recent cases.\n</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n\"You couldn't even compare this with Ferguson or the [Eric] Garner case in New York,\" said Hoskins, who is African American. \"The Garner case in New York, they had the video; Ferguson they did not. We have the video. I can assure you what is on the video, we're going to use.\"\n</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nThe latest shooting happened at 11:15 p.m. Tuesday at a Mobil gas station, St. Louis County Chief of Police Jon Belmar said in a morning news conference.\n</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/exclusive-watch-george-stephanopoulos-full-interview-police-officer-27186831\" target=\"_blank\">WATCH: George Stephanopoulos' Full Interview With Police Officer </a><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/michael-brown-ferguson.htm\" id=\"ramplink_Darren Wilson_\" target=\"_blank\">Darren Wilson</a>\n</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/people-walk-work-school-ferguson-protests/story?id=27288450\" target=\"_blank\">People Walk Out Of Work, School in Ferguson Protests</a>\n</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/st-louis-rams-police-disagree-apology-players-ferguson/story?id=27295696\" target=\"_blank\">St. Louis Rams, Police Disagree Over 'Apology' for Players' Ferguson Gesture</a>\n</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nBelmar said police visited the gas station when a report of a larceny came in. The victim, who is 18 years old that has not been officially named by police, pointed a gun at the officer which sparked the deadly shooting, Belmar said.\n</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n\"Bad choices were made,\" Belmar said. \"This individual could have complied, he could have ran away, he could have dropped the gun.\"\n</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nThe shooting sparked a new wave of unrest in the region, which has been wracked by anxiety following the August shooting of Michael Brown, 18, in nearby Ferguson. Following Tuesday’s shooting, a crowd of 200 to 300 people swarmed the gas station, with four people arrested and a police officer sustaining a leg injury, said Belmar, who is white.\n</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n</p><figure class=\"e_image e_full\" id=\"e_image_27809026\"><div class=\"e_full_container\"><picture><img src=\"http://a.abcnews.go.com/images/US/AP_SHOOTING_141224_DG_4x3_992.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"PHOTO: Police try to control a crowd, Dec. 24, 2014, on the lot of a gas station following a shooting in Berkeley, Mo.\"/><span class=\"credit\">David Carson/St. Louis Post-Dispatch/AP Photo</span></picture></div><figcaption><span class=\"caption\">Police try to control a crowd, Dec. 24, 2014, on the lot of a gas station following a shooting in Berkeley, Mo.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n</p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nSt. Louis County Police released surveillance video today showing the moments before the shooting. The officer can be seen parking his vehicle, and a conversation ensues. The man’s arm appears to be raised -- but the video is inconclusive, captured from the side of the building a considerable distance away.\n</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nPolice also released a second and third video this afternoon showing surveillance footage captured from other angles of the gas station parking lot. However, in the second video, neither the teen nor the police officer are clearly visible in the footage at the moment the shooting happens, but one man can be seen running away.\n</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n</p><p class=\"t_markup youtube\"/>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\n</p>\n<p itemprop=\"articleBody\">\nIn the third video, the police officer can be seen stumbling backward as he fires shots and then falling.
