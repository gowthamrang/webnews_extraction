She's defended her office.</p><p>On Sept. 20, 2013, Fredericksen allegedly struck the suspect in a station garage after an argument. Fredericksen was later fired.</p><p>Tuesday's statement didn't identify the allegedly victim and doesn't give either man's race. It also doesn't mention a defense attorney.</p><p>A judge Tuesday set Fredericksen's bond at $10,000.</p><p>A surveillance video from that night shows Randolph Holmes being handcuffed by Fredrickson's former partner Kayvon Karimi. Karimi is no longer with the department.</p><p>Holmes and Fredericksen appear to argue before Fredericksen slams Holmes into a door and pushes him into a hallway. Karimi then uses a pressure-point technique to bring Holmes to the ground in the hallway.</p><p>Another surveillance camera in the garage area shows Holmes being taken to the ground again as Fredericksen walks him to a squad car.</p>\n            <p id=\"video-ad-asset-container\">\n                <video id=\"video-ad-asset\" class=\"video-responsive video-js vjs-default-skin\"/>\n            </p>\n        \n        <p>Holmes suffered a concussion and broken nose.</p><p>Fredericksen was hired by the Lynwood Police Department in 2004 and worked with the South Suburban Emergency Response Team and gang unit.</p><p>He was allowed to remain on the the street until being put under investigation and on paid administrative leave in July 2014. He was fired in January 2015 following a disciplinary hearing.</p><p>Former Police Chief Michael Mears, also of Lowell, was Fredericksen's chief at the time of the incident. Mears resigned as chief on June 1, 2014.</p>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n                    </div></body></html>", "Title": "Ex-Lynwood cop charged in alleged beating of handcuffed suspect"}
