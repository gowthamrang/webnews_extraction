Many people showed up with their feelings printed on signs.</p><p>Some opponents wore stickers that say \"Freedom to Choose\" and \"No to the Smoking Ban.\"</p><p>Musician Irvin Mayfield spoke in favor of the ban. So did Deacon John who got a little emotional.</p><p>\"I am sick and tired of witnessing our beloved musicians and artists suffering and dying from the detrimental effects of Second hand smoke. I have sang at their funerals,\" John said.</p><p>Some French Quarter business owners said security issues are costing them business and now is not the time for a ban.</p><p>\"A lot of our businesses have seen a 20-percent drop in revenue as a result of the increasing crime in the French Quarter,\" Alex Fein, we feel that this extra burden of lost revenue at this time would be a little bit too much to take.\"</p><p>The ban would also apply to the smoking of electronic cigarettes. Supporters says too little is known about the effects of the chemicals emitted from the e-cigarettes.</p><p>The city council will not vote on the ordinance until a future date.</p><p><span>Copyright 2015 <a href=\"http://fox8live.com\">WVUE</a>.
