 Paramedics arrived and pronounced the bike rider dead at the scene, police said.

The same automobile, now with a broken windshield, then struck another car on East 128th St and Madison Ave, where the driver and passengers fled the scene, according to cops.

Police are looking for two men and a possibly a woman who fled the scene.

NYPD is investigating the incident.
