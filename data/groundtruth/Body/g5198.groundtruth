During a recent interview, Arizona lawman Joe Arpaio offered a stark forecast for fellow law enforcement officers across the nation. Following Saturday’s execution style shooting of two New York City police officers, the Maricopa County sheriff appeared on Breitbart News Sunday to offer his thoughts.

He echoed other critics in placing at least some of the accountability on activists like Al Sharpton who have stoked racial tensions over the past several months.

“We better tell him to chill out,” he said of the civil rights leader, “knock it off, stop going to the White House, sitting next to the president, and talking about race.”
