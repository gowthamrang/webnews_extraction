Within moments, Strong drove away and shots were being fired.

Police found two handguns on the driver's side floorboard of Strong's car and crack cocaine in the center console, according to the grand jury's findings.

The officers are being accused of civil rights violations for unnecessarily using deadly force when Strong did not pose a threat.

The suit also takes aim at the policies and procedures put in place by defendant City of Tallahassee that create "an atmosphere of illegal and unconstitutional behavior" related to use of force and that it failed to screen, discipline or terminate officers who use excessive force, profile and target establishments for harassment.

The city "had a custom and practice of allowing officers to conduct illegal traffic stops, illegal searches and seizures, the targeting and profiling of local establishments for harassment and closure, the drawing weapons at non-violent persons, to use excessive, and unreasonable force without fear of discipline, thereby creating an atmosphere where such behavior is accepted," the suit states.
