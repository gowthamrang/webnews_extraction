 UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- State police say they're investigating after someone threw a brick onto a New York parkway, smashing a moving car's windshield and injuring a passenger.

Troopers say Sunday that the brick was tossed onto the Meadowbrook Parkway on Long Island from a pedestrian footbridge just before 8 p.m. Saturday.

They say a 22-year-old woman in the passenger seat of a blue 1996 BMW was treated for eye and mouth injuries at a hospital and then released. They say the 21-year-old man driving the car suffered a bruised right shoulder but refused medical attention.

Troopers say the driver and his passenger called 911 after their windshield was smashed as they drove northbound on the parkway.
