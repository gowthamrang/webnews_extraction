 A MAN who allegedly filmed a woman in the toilet of an inner city bar has handed himself in to police.

Investigators have been told the 24-year-old woman was in the toilet cubicle of a bar on Brunswick St, Fitzroy, about 7.30pm on January 21.

It is alleged the woman suddenly noticed a mobile phone being held under the door with the camera facing her.

Frightened, she left the toilets before notifying staff.

A female bartender entered the toilets and found a man hiding inside one of the cubicles.

When confronted, the man allegedly told her he had mistaken it for the menâ€™s toilets.

The Melbourne man, 27, fronted Melbourne East police station this afternoon, where he was interviewed by police.

Investigators seized a mobile phone for forensic examination and the man was released pending further inquiries.

Police earlier trawled through CCTV footage outside the Brunswick St bar to capture a man they believed could assist with their investigation.

Anyone who has any information on the incident is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
