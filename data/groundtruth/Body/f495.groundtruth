In a statement, police said Officer Monsies Robles stopped a green Ford Mustang for failure to use a turn signal at Oakville Road and Hackberry Street about 10:30 a.m.
Robles then approached the driver and passenger, whom he believed to be in the country illegally, the statement says.
Officer Noah Leuschner joined Robles and asked the driver and passenger for identification, but they said they didn't have any, according to the statement.
The driver, later identified as Margarito Martinez Gallegos, then ran off, the statement says. Robles chased him while Leuschner detained the passenger.
Robles called out to the suspect several times, identifying himself as an officer and ordering him to stop, but Gallegos kept running until he reached the front door of a home in the 1500 block of Hackberry Street, the statement says.
Robles then used a stun gun on Gallegos because “I did not know what the subject's intentions were,” according to the statement.
Gallegos fell into the home and shut the door. Robles followed him inside and found him in the kitchen.
Leuschner walked inside and requested backup from the Texas Department of Public Safety. Robles and Gallegos began scuffling, the statement says.
After Gallegos grabbed Robles' stun gun and refused Robles' order to drop it, Leusch- ner fatally shot Gallegos in the abdomen with his service pistol, according to the statement.
Robles was taken to an area hospital for treatment of leg injuries suffered during the scuffle.
