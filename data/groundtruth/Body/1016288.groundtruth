 Hyco, the police dog who was shot and killed by a suspect in an Anderson County carjacking case, will live on in the South Carolina Code of Laws, if a bill prefiled by Easley House member Neal Collins and members of the Anderson County delegation becomes law.

The bill would stiffen the penalties for harming or killing a dog or horse used by law enforcement, instituting a minimum mandatory sentence of two years for killing one of these animals.

Called â€œFargoâ€™s and Hycoâ€™s Law,â€ the bill would raise the fine up to $20,000 and require restitution for the cost of replacing the expensive animals. Fargo was a K-9 in Richland County. He was killed in December 2011 after chasing a robbery suspect.

â€œTo me itâ€™s a commonsense bill that strengthens something that needs to be strengthened,â€ said Collins, a first-term Republican. â€œI think the community is definitely in support of this.â€

Four people were charged with two counts of attempted murder and one count of cruelty to a police dog or horse in the incident that led to Hycoâ€™s death on Oct. 21.

Under current law, the offense is a misdemeanor with a penalty of 1-5 years in jail with possible suspended sentences, or a fine of $500 to $1,000. Offenders charged under the new law, if it passes,Â would face 2-10 years in jail with no possibility of suspension or parole and/or a fine of $2,000 to $20,000.

In addition, violators would be required to pay restitution covering the full cost of replacing the animal and could be requiredÂ to serveÂ one year of animal-related community service.

The same penalty would apply to anyone who would â€œwillfully or maliciously torture, mutilate, injure, disable, poison,â€ a police animal whether it dies or not.

The penalty for abusing a police dog or horse would remain $2,000 to $5,000 and/or 30 days to five years in jail.

That applies to anyone who would â€œwillfully and maliciously taunt, torment, tease, beat, strike, or administer or subject a desensitizing drug, chemical, or substanceâ€ to such an animal.

Not only are police dogs valuable to the law enforcement efforts of their handlers, but they are expensive.

Replacing highly trained dogs like Hyco costs about $8,000, Collins said.

â€œSo we wanted to include in there some sort of restitution for the law enforcement agencies to be able to replace the animals,â€ he said.

Collins said he got the idea to upgrade the penalty for killing police animals after speaking to an animal rights group last spring. Fargoâ€™s handler also was a speaker at the program.

Fargo, a five-year-old Belgian Malinois that worked for the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Office, was killed on Dec. 16, 2011 in circumstances similar to which Hyco died.

He had been released on an armed robbery suspect and had caught him when the suspect shot him three times with a handgun.

Collins was drafting a bill when Hyco was killed.

â€œAt that point, the Anderson County delegation jumped on board,â€ Collins said.

Rep. Jonathan Hill of Townville had a separate bill in the works, and the two lawmakers merged their bills and drew language from a bill written but never introduced by Rep. Jenny Horne of Summerville.

The bill, H. 4448, has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee.

Sen. Kevin Bryant, R-Anderson, has prefiled a companion bill in the Senate.
