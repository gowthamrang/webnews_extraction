 A former principal at Detroitâ€™s Mumford High School said Thursday she cut a deal to pleadÂ guilty toÂ bribery and tax evasion for her role in a wide-ranging FBI investigation of corruption and kickbacks within the Detroit Public Schools and schools run by the Education Achievement Authority.

Kenyetta (K.C.) Wilbourn-Snapp, a petite,Â feisty woman known for carrying a baseball bat in one school and driving aÂ Maserati while at a second, told the Free Press ThursdayÂ afternoonÂ that she is pleading guilty to accepting a $58,000 bribe and to tax evasion.

Wilbourn-Snapp said her attorney, Steve Fishman, met with her on Tuesday and told her, "I donâ€™t know if I have good news, but the goal is to keep you out of jail. They want you to take a plea. Tax evasion."

Fishman declined comment and withdrew from the case after Wilbourn-Snapp spoke to the Free Press.

Gina Balaya, spokeswomanÂ for theÂ U.S. Attorney's Office, declined comment on the case, exceptÂ to say: "While we cannot comment on this story, in general, we do not prohibit defendants from speaking to the press, and we do not withdraw plea offers to those who do."

Wilbourn-Snapp, once a rising star in the DPS system,Â was hailed as a turnaround specialist at Denby High School before she moved to Mumford Â High. Both were DPS schoolsÂ that became part of theÂ controversial reform district that was created in 2012 Â to turn around the bottom 5% of Michigan schools.

In anticipation of a guilty plea hearing, supporters of Wilbourn-Snapp have writtenÂ letters of support and requests for leniency.

â€œKenyetta has been an inspiration for people like me looking for a better way to reach our dreams and fulfill our potential,â€ said one suchÂ letter obtained by the Free Press. "Â â€¦ Kenyetta has always reiterated to me that when you make an error in judgement or are faced with adversity or challenges: you step up, take responsibility and face them head on. I see that Kenyetta is practicing what she preached and I respect her that much more because of it. Â Iâ€™m requesting that you ... show leniency on Kenyetta.â€

A plea hearing has not yet been scheduled. A federal judge has to accept a guilty plea before it is considered official.

The FBI is investigating Wilbourn-SnappÂ and others in yet anotherÂ public corruption scandal in Detroit, this oneÂ targeting officials and contractors with DPS and the EAA, according to multiple sources.

This latest development comes days after another former Detroit school officialÂ pleaded guilty to publicÂ corruption crimes in Chicago.

Ex-DPS consultant Barbara Byrd-Bennett, the former CEO of Chicago Public Schools, pleaded guilty on TuesdayÂ to steering a $23-million contract to a company in IllinoisÂ in exchange for cash kickbacks, including a college fund for her grandchildren.

Officials familiar with the FBI corruption probe in DetroitÂ say Byrd-Bennett also is under investigation for similar activity here, drawing scrutiny for allegedly helping toÂ steer a contract to aÂ textbook publishingÂ companyÂ she once worked for.

Byrd-Bennett's Chicago attorney,Â Michael Scudder,Â declined to comment. So did the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office.

There is no known connection between Byrd-Bennett and Wilbourn-Snapp, who abruptly resigned last November after federal agents raided her apartment at the Double Tree Hilton Hotel downtown.

Six months after Wilbourn-Snappâ€™s resignation, the FBI sent a letter to the EAA
