 Murder, attempted murder and assault were part of the fabric of 2015. Two of the most-read cases in Limestone County involved a former Athens man accused in a double murder in Tennessee, a Limestone County couple charged in the bathtub scalding of two children, and a Madison police officer accused of injuring an Indian man in a takedown. Here are some of the major cases that occurred this past year:
Double murder
A Nashville police detective testified he noticed "the smell of death in the breezeway" as he approached an east Nashville apartment on Sept. 26. Inside a utility closet of the Howe Garden apartment on Greenwood Avenue, law enforcement officials found the bodies of Preston Claybrooks Jr., 24, and his longtime girlfriend, Alexandra Grubbs, 23. Claybrooksâ€™ mother went to the apartment Sept. 26 after reporting her son missing two days before. She noticed a smell and called police.
A former Athens native, 20-year-old Brandon Griswold, and his 21-year-old girlfriend, Whitney Gray, an Oklahoma native, were charged with their murders. Investigators believe Griswold and Gray bludgeoned the couple with a hammer and a microphone stand on Sept. 21. The victims also had their throats cut. They were found wrapped in sheets and blankets in a utility closet of Griswold's apartment, where all four of them had been staying. Gray later told investigators Claybrooks was a heroin dealer and that she and Griswold owed him $650 for heroin and did not want to repay it.
Bathtub scalding
A Limestone County mother and boyfriend were charged with attempted murder and other offenses for allegedly scalding her two children in the bathtub of their home at 21038 Tillman Mill Road on June 14.
Amanda Marie Reyer, 23, and her boyfriend, Derrick Lynn Defoe, 30, are each awaiting trial on two counts of attempted murder, two counts of aggravated child abuse and two counts of first-degree domestic violence.
Reyer had taken the girl to Athens-Limestone Hospital the evening of June 14 and claimed she fell into a hot tub. The report triggered an investigation that showed the boy had also been scalded.
Adriauna, who was 2 Â½ at the time, suffered second- and third-degree burns over 80 percent of her body. Limestone County District Attorney Brian Jones said the little girl was in water up to her neck. Cameron, who was 5 at the time, suffered second- and third-degree burns over 30 percent of his body.
