GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) â€” Police in Guyana say they have arrested a man suspected of recently killing three people with a machete, including a 9-year-old girl.

Police spokesman Ivelaw Whittaker said Saturday that officers arrested 40-year-old Joshua Franklin in a wooden shack in a sugarcane field. Police accused him of attacking his ex-girlfriend last week as well as the woman's daughter, mother and current partner.

Officials said Franklin's ex-girlfriend remains hospitalized but is expected to recover.

Franklin is expected to appear in court on Monday.
