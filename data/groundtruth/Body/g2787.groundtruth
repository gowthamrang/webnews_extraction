There are many creative ways to failing a drunk driving test—by eating the breathalyzer, for example—but one man in Wisconsin went the simple route, and simply gave up on the test halfway through, telling cops he was going to kill them all. To each their own.

According to Pioneer Press, 30-year-old Kong P. Vue crashed his car after 2 a.m. on Sunday. After police arrived, he explained that his axle broke, and added that he had a beer downtown. Intrigued, cops then had Vue recite the alphabet. He got to K before he blew it. “A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-G-K — I’m gonna kill all y’all.”

Obviously, he did not pass the test. Police arrested him, and he’s now facing a fourth-offense OWI, as well as for operating with a revoked license, and for a hit and run. Should’ve just finished the alphabet.
